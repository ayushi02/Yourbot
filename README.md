# Yourbot
 A Chatbot using Flask Api and using SQLAlchemy
 
 This is a bot based on flask. It get gets trained each time when user interacts with a new query.
 
 It is just like how machine learning works.Initially its output is not trained but as more and more data gatters it traind itself to give more efficient result.This is exactly what I just illustrated.
 
 Initailly database is empty.But as user interacts ,it fills the database on how it should react for particular response.
 
 Whenever user gives any string ,it figures out important words andcalculates the frequency of that word in a sentence and the word having largest frequency becomes dominant and answers it according to that response.
 
 It is just an example how machine learning works.
